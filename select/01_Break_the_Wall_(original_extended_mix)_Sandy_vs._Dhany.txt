I wanna be somebody
Give me freedom
And I'll be all right
Cause what I'm feeling
No one knows
And we all need to go back where we belong
Never give me orders
Never give me roles
I don't wanna walk in the middle of the rows
Even in the most religious family there's a rebel
With my new education now
Here I'm coming down
Turn on the power
Turn on the world
Never let them tell you to stop the wave of soul
And with your head up high you'll finally see the light
In a crazy world of people you're the one to choose your life
I wanna break the wall
I wanna break it
I wanna break the wall
I wanna break the wall
I wanna feel the passion
Give me music
And I'll be all right
Cause only rhythm
Makes me roll
And we all need to go back where we belong
Never give me warnings
Never give me rules
Cause you know my mind is the only thing I use
And you know that I'm not going to follow your traditions
I don't care if it's right or wrong
I'll be on my own
Turn on the fever
Turn on the world
Never let them cool your emotion when it flows
Your eyes are open wide you finally see the light
You're the maker of your future you're the one to choose your life
