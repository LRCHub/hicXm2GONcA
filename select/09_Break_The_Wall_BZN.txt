I lost my head, for I broke my leg and my lover was on the run
And I fell asleep, and the heat was on, so I burned down in the sun

Oh come on, don't be silly, hold your head up high
'Cause there ain't no time to lose
So come on,
Come on break the wall

I came in late, and I couldn't sleep a wink
Though I always count the sheep
I called me mum, but she couldn't come, she is such a mean machine

Oh come on, don't be silly, hold your head up high
'Cause there ain't no time to lose
So come on,
Come on break the wall

(Do-it, do-it)
Well I got me a boss, and I worked like a horse, I got blisters on my feet
I was doing all right, but I still got fired, he is such a mean machine

Oh come on, don't be silly, hold your head up high
'Cause there ain't no time to lose
So come on,
Come on break the wall

Take it, shake it, you've got to break the wall
Keep on dancin', you've got no time at all
So come on
Come on, break the wall

Well I had an affair, but he grabbed my hair and he hit me in the eye
And he hit my nose, and he tore all my clothes and he didn't tell me why

Oh come on, don't be silly, hold your head up high
'Cause there ain't no time to lose
So come on,
Come on break the wall

Take it, shake it, you've got to break the wall
Keep on dancin', you've got no time at all
So come on
Come on, break the wall

We all get by, and we'll break down the wall
Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
We all get by, and we'll break down the wall

We all get by, and we'll break down the wall
(Break down the wall)
Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
(No, you can't have it all)
We all get by, and we'll break down the wall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
(No no no no no no no-ho)
We all get by, and we'll break down the wall
(Oh, no you can't have it all)

Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
(Oh, no no no no no no)
We all get by, and we'll break down the wall
(Oh, yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah)

Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
(You can't break the wall)
We all get by, and we'll break down the wall

Now it's the time, though you can't have it all
We all get by...
