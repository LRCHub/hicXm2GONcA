(Die)
No sign of my time
'Cause I wish to live another life
(By)
Who will save my poor soul
Crying alone in a dim hole
(My)
Can't believe it's real
'Cause in the end, everything is gone
(Side)
How should I live from now
Find myself staring at the walls
Tonight, I'll break the wall
It's now or never
Now, I'm on my own
I've gotta get free
Bite, I'll break the chain
Run to my shelter
Make it out alive
I have to break through the wall
(Die)
No sign of my crime
Got my scars during wartime
(By)
Who's the one that did it
Deadly venom eating me inside
(My)
Spent my life in vein
I can't forget everything I've done
(Side)
I swear to my hatred
Find myself staring at the walls
Tonight, I'll break the wall
It's now or never
Now, I'm on my own
I've gotta get free
Bite, I'll break the chain
Run to my shelter
Make it out alive
I have to break through the wall
(Die)
No sign of my time
'Cause I wish to live another life
(By)
Who will save my poor soul
Crying alone in a dim hole
(My)
Can't believe it's real
'Cause in the end, everything is gone
(Side)
How should I live from now
Find myself staring at the walls
Tonight, I'll break the wall
It's now or never
Now, I'm on my own
I've gotta get free
Bite, I'll break the chain
Run to my shelter
Make it out alive
I have to break through the-
I have to break through the-
I have to break through the wall
